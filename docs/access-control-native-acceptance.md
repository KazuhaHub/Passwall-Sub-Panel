# Native destination traffic acceptance

The `Native destination traffic acceptance` workflow runs a real Node daemon
against PSP's production `Build` router, TLS sync endpoint, administrator HTTP
routes, SQLite stores, and destination audit worker. It never fabricates a Node
report or an applied receipt, and it never rewrites the emitted core artifact.

The Node candidate is pinned to
`KazuhaHub/Passwall-Node@63c60f6d5e8cd093bbaa8385f5b514dbe2f40390`.
This is a reviewed development candidate, not a published stable release. Its
own preferred Go compiler is checked separately from PSP's preferred compiler.
No local module replacement is used. The daemon installs and runs each exact
Xray version: `26.6.27`, `26.7.28`, and `26.9.9`.
The isolated fixture explicitly acknowledges the reviewed restricted `26.9.9`
selection; the production catalog gate remains enforced.

Every matrix job must execute all nine ordered cases: empty policy, watch,
block, pause/resume, anonymous allowlist trial, enforce, supplemental entry,
collection off, and detailed usage. Allow/deny is checked against an actual
VLESS HTTP request and the destination's nonce and request count. Audit and
usage counts come from the real ingestion worker. The usage HTTP read must
also create its declared administrator audit action.

Current candidate readiness requires its published generation, a mint after
the administrator mutation, a matching applied report, and an accepted sync
after that mint. Desired candidates additionally require the matching confirmed
LKG. Empty and paused candidates may retain a different historical LKG;
unchanged report timestamps are not treated as a new status transition.

The driver only runs as root on a disposable GitHub-hosted Linux VM. It adds
one random run-owned `2001:db8::/128` address to loopback, verifies its exact
local route, and removes that exact address after stopping the daemon. TLS
trust is scoped to a temporary CA file; host trust stores and core private
address protections are unchanged. Credentials and process output stay in
temporary private files or memory and are never uploaded. The retained artifact
contains Go test execution results and count-only assertions. The result parser
rejects missing, duplicate, failed, or skipped cases.

This gate covers one native node with one VLESS TCP listener and one user on
SQLite. The fixture provisions those records directly, obtains a normal admin
JWT, then uses production HTTP routes for every tested policy mutation. It
starts `Build` and the audit worker, not all `App.Run` background services. It
does not replace full service installation/reinstall acceptance, SQL matrix
tests, sing-box acceptance, fallback/rejection scenarios, load testing, the
complete UI approval matrix, or staged release verification.

Use the workflow run and PR validation record for execution evidence. All three
jobs must pass on the exact current PR head; an earlier or partial matrix does
not satisfy this gate.
